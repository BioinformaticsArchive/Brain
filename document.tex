\section{Summary:}
This section should summarize the purpose/novel features of the program in one or two sentences.

\section{Availability and Implementation:}
This section should state software availability if the paper focuses mainly on 
software development or on the implementation of an algorithm. Examples are:
Freely available on the web at http://www.example.org. Website implemented in Perl, MySQL and 
Apache, with all major browsers supported'; or 'Source code and binaries freely available for download at URL, 
implemented in C++ and supported on linux and MS Windows'. The complete address (URL) should be given. If the manuscript 
describes new software tools or the implementation of novel algorithms the software must be freely available to non-commercial 
users. Authors must also ensure that the software is available for a full TWO YEARS following publication. The editors of 
Bioinformatics encourage authors to make their source code available and, if possible, to provide access through an open source 
license see www.opensource.org for examples.
